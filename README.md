Ricetta
======

Personal recipes. Global curation.

Ricetta is an application which allows for personal recipe management in a global community of fellow cooks. It's two components, a RESTful API written in Go and a Backbone/Marionette application, work in tandem to deliver a new way to digitally store your own personal recipes.

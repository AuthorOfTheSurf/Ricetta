Personal recipes. Global curation. Ricetta is an application which allows for personal recipe management in a global community of fellow cooks.

This project is made up of two components:
* a RESTful API written in Go
* a Backbone/Marionette web application

These components work in tandem to deliver a new way to digitally store your own personal recipes.
